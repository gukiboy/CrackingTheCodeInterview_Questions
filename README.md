## How to make it well organized

* Create a folder for each chapter
	* Inside each chapter folder, create an exercise folder

* Put the exercise description as a commentary inside the code
and the commit you done for it.

* Try to keep the commits specific to one exercise only, don't
solve more than one exercise at a time
